  "aliasFAQFirstQuestion": "What are Signum Aliases?",
  "aliasFAQFirstAnswer": "Easy to use and customization are at the core of Signum. Compared to Bitcoin for example, Signum addresses are generally shorter and easier to read. To make this process even simpler, the Signum team developed an alias system to give every Signum address or customized data set a human-friendly and unique phrase.",
  "aliasFAQSecondQuestion": "How do I check if an Alias is available?",
  "aliasFAQSecondAnswer": "To check if an Alias name is available, just type it in an Alias Marketplace search bar and we'll tell you immediately if someone else already owns it.",
  "aliasFAQThirdQuestion": "How do I buy Aliases?",
  "aliasFAQThirdAnswer": "Think about what business name or specialty you'd like for your Alias. Type the alias you want into the Alias Marketplace Search Bar. We'll tell you if that particular Alias is available.",
  "aliasFAQFourthQuestion": "Will i be able to transfer or sell my alias?",
  "aliasFAQFourthAnswer": "Yes. Aliases that are registered to your Signum address can be transferred to another Signum address, or can be offered for sale.\nYou can also change the type of your Alias. All these actions are built-in functions on the Signum blockchain.\nSignum Aliases are a new kind of tradable asset.",
  "aliasFAQFifthQuestion": "How do payments work with my account aliases?",
  "aliasFAQFifthAnswer": "When someone types your alias into any of our supporting wallets, the wallet looks up that Alias on the blockchain, finds the appropriate address, and sends the crypto to the address associated with that alias.",
  "aliasFAQSixthQuestion": "Can I change the address my Alias points to after I've bought it?",
  "aliasFAQSixthAnswer": "Yes, you can update the addresses or other content pointed to by your Alias at any time."
